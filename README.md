Hello, and thanks for grading my project!
I don't have a replit subscription but I really need to get this certificate to get my degree at a university course.
So I uploaded it to GitHub.
It's a bit more complicated than the codes you've been learned at the course but meets all of the requirements.
If you open the index.html file, you'll see:
  - that it's a fully formed page with doctype, head and body elements
  - that it has way more than three semantic tags.
  - that it has an h1 tag in the "banner" section
  - that it has a list and it functions as a navbar
  - that it has three images in the "services" section
  - that it has an external link (my existing, real email adrees) in the footer
I hope that'll help you to grade my assesment.
Thanks again!
Best wishes,
Zsolti
