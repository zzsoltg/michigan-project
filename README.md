# michigan-project
Hello, and thanks for grading my project!
I don't have a replit subscription but I really need to get this certificate to get my degree at a university course.
So I uploaded it to GitHub.
It's a bit more complicated than the codes you've been learned at the course but meets all of the requirements.
If you open the index.html file, you'll see:
  - that it's a fully formed page with doctype, head and body elements
  - that it has way more than three semantic tags.
  - that it has an h1 tag in the "banner" section
  - that it has a list and it functions as a navbar
  - that it has three images in the "services" section
  - that it has an external link (my existing, real email adrees) in the footer

Please keep in mind that the website only will get it's proper look with the css code embedded.
So if you choose to download the html, download the css also, and place these two in the same folder, and open the webpage only afterwards.
You can also visit the final result in the following link: https://michigan-project.netlify.app/
I hope that'll help you to grade my assesment.

Thanks again!

Best wishes,

Zsolti
